# node-fuse-demo

Node.js Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) Demo.

This project uses native bindings provided by [node-fuse-bindings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fuse-bindings)
and provides patches to enable Node 20 compatibility.

## Requirements

**Operating System**: üçè macOS or üêß Linux. ü™ü Windows has not been tested but may work with [Dokan](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany).

**Runtime:** Node 20+, pnpm

**Additional Packages:** libfuse

### macOS

**These instructions assume the use of Homebrew. MacPorts users should adapt commands as appropriate.**

- Refer [How to Install macFUSE](https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/wiki/Getting-Started#how-to-install-macfuse) to install and configure **macFUSE**
- Install **Xcode Command Line Tools**: `xcode-select --install`
- Install **pkgconf**: `brew install pkgconf`

### Linux

**These instructions are for **Ubuntu 22.04**. Non-debian users should adapt commands as appropriate. Required Packages:**

- libfuse2
- libfuse-dev
- pkg-config

**From a terminal execute:**

```sh
sudo apt install libfuse2 libfuse-dev pkg-config
```

### Windows

**Windows has not been tested. WSL2 should work for mounting volumes within the WSL filesystem. Alternatively, native
Windows compatibility may be poassible using [Dokan](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany).**

## Installation

- **Refer to the platform specific instructions under [Requirements](#requirements) before proceeding.**
- Clone the repository and open a terminal in the project directory.
- Ensure Node 20+ and pnpm are available. If Node is not installed or less than the required version, you can run
`./setup.sh` which will download a compatible runtime using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#about).
- Run `pnpm install` to download package dependencies.

## Usage

Run `pnpm start` to start the application, the FUSE volume is mounted on `./mnt`. If the application crashes or fails to
unmount the volume on exit, try running: `pnpm unmount`.

The default log level is `INFO`. The log level can be configured by providing the parameter `--log-level=`, e.g.
`pnpm start --log-level=TRACE`.
